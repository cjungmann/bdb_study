# Berkeley Database Study

The Berkeley Database (bdb) seems like an interesting database
product.  Its low-level C-library approach seems similar to the
[FairCom DB](https://www.faircom.com/products/faircom-db) engine
I used back in the late 1990s.

The Berkeley Database is appealing because it is part of Linux
and BSD distributions and has very small footprint.  It rewards
detailed planning of the data, and it is an excuse to explore
some of my C language ideas.
